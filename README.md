A Betting algorithm that takes a constant value to determine correct scores
I get the GA and GF for both Teams
Get the GA and GF for both away and Home for the Specific league
The GA and GF for the individual teams are then divide by the total number of games played so far
The GA and GF for the specific League is divided by a constant value( Number of games in a season *10)
the two results are then multiplied to predict goals to score for each team
